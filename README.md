How to add??

* Click the 1bash file (above) and search for that ticker and then add them to your 1bash.

* Do the same on 0miner file too, also make sure you select that particular coin in 1bash (COIN="XXXX").

Please do this only if you are interested in pre/early mining (some may turnout to be 
good coins and some just get wasted, some may don't even go to exchange - you never know), 
but I've seen very good results by mining new coins.

Best eg; I've early mined PIRL for 5 days and it has paid of my RIG investment and I've 
mined many other shit coins like XMRL, IRD (this isn't a shit coin) etc which didn't even reached exchanges.

I'm only doing this for people like me who has only 1 RIG to mine and do mining just as a hobby.

Please note that myself/nvOC Team doesn't affiliate with these coins, I just add them based on my (just myself) 
perception and you make the decision whether to consider it or not.
