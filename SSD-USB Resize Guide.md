#SSD-USB resize guide for nvOC.

Open Gparted, it will ask for root password (miner1), Locate your drive, there are 2 partitions, a 9Mb fat, a 16Gb ext4 and a free unused space at the end. 

Right click on the unused space, create new partition, "Partition Type : Swap" make the size you want (1Gb up to Ram size) grab and move it to the end of drive. Apply.

Right clcik on the primary 16gb partition, resize/move, resize it to the desired size (better to give it all). Apply.

Right click on the swap partition and get the info, copy the UUID. 

open /etc/fstab with this command

```gksudo gedit /etc/fstab```

You will see a line which refers to a swap partition during installation ... 

Some thing similar to this :

```
swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation

UUID=cdba7b01-5ae6-4104-9a6e-f723b8bd87ac none            swap    sw              0       0
```


Change the UUID with the one you copied from newly made swap partition.

Save and close gedit.

Activate swap with:

```sudo swapon --all```

It will read your fstab and enable the swap partition.

Check it with free command in  terminal

```
