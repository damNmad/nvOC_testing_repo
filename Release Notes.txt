3main edits :
  Removed the infinite loops and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks (stubo)
  Bug fix for 1050 Ti where pstate3 was not OC'ed (stubo) 
  Removed repetitive if LOCAL then "screen -r miner" from each mining block and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks (stubo)
  Added support for BTG 
  Added telemetry/api to EWBF and ZM miner launches so that you can hit <host>:42000 to see this miner output (stubo)
  Added the ability to pass in a miner password for all miners that have the "--pass" arg. (stubo)
  Changed instances of "--pass x" and "--pass x"  and "-p x" to "--pass $MINER_PWD" (stubo)
  Changed dstm zm location to "~/zec/zm/latest/" for easier future updates (papampi)
  Changed all miner start scripts to use separate pool and port from 1bash so watchdog can check the pool connection easier (papampi)
  Added log rotate settings (papampi)
  Moved miner start from 3main to 0miner, to make 3main lighter and better handle of miner start (papampi)
  Added auto start miner yes or no ( in case you need to edit or debug the rig) (papampi)
  Bug fix - $pwr_lim_daggerhashimoto5 corrected to $pwr_lim_daggerhashimoto (leenoox)
  Bug fix - INDIVIDUAL settings were applied to GPU's 0-13 only. Fixed to work with 0-18 (leenoox)
  Partial code cleanup (leenoox)
  Added GPU LED Logo brightness control (leenoox)

1bash edits:
  Added EWBF_OPTS and ZM_OPTS for telemetry/api to EWBF and ZM miner (stubo)
  Added MINER_PWD for miner passwords (stubo)
  Unified and separated all pool address and pool ports so wdog can check if pool is up or no if needed (papampi)
  Updated contributors list and release name (leenoox)
  Reformat and clean-up (leenoox)

wdog edits:
  Added check if miner is running or not when utilization dropped to restart miner faster (stubo)
  Added check for internet and wait if its down (stubo)
  Added check mining pool:port if internet is up and wait before restart miner and reboot system (papampi)
  Added "Warning" to log output of alerts to catch them easier (papampi)
  Changed logfile location to tmpfs (papampi)
  Fixed a bug in logging system to limit logs to 500 lines
  Added checking number of gpus installed vs system reported gpus at start of wdog, so you know if a gpu is not working (papampi)
  Changed sleep time before wdog goin on watch to be based on gpu counts (papampi)
  Set higher process and disk I/O priorities - watchdog is essential service
  Code optimization (leenoox)
  Workaround for some 1050's reporting "Unknown" or "ERR" when power.draw is queried from nvidi-smi (leenoox)

temp control (by leenoox):
  Set higher process and disk I/O priorities - Temp control is essential service
  Auto detection of number of GPU's
  Only set, adjust and display available GPU's, dynamic variables creation
  Numeric check of the return values from nvidia-smi (looking for numbers only, anything else = error)
  Reboot if GPU error detected and watchdog didn't react for 60 seconds (act as a backup watchdog)
  Added query delay to nvidia API (no burst spamming, added 0.5 sec delay, prevent overload), helps reduce stale shares
  New (improved) display output including colors and bold text
  Fixed the log file handling (Bug fix: Previous implemantation was not limiting the file size)
  Removed repetitive GPUFanControlState setting, it only needs to be set once, not every cycle (prevent API overload)
  Workaround for some 1050's reporting "Unknown" or "ERR" when power.draw is queried from nvidi-smi

nvOC utility (by stubo):
  New function based utility that has many features including gpuinfo, stop, start, clearlogs, restart, etc.
   

Others: 
  Added log rotation (papampi)
  Changed minerinfo and papampi-telegram for new log locations (papampi)
  Create tmpfs partition to change logfile location to tmpfs to lower read/writes to HDD/USB (papampi)
  Changed minerinfo web so those who dont use wtm dont see empty or no wtm entries (papampi)
