=================================================================================

How to add??

* Click the 1bash file (above) and search for that ticker and then add them to your 1bash.

* Do the same on 0miner file too, also make sure you select that particular coin in 1bash (COIN="XXXX").

Please do this only if you are interested in pre/early mining (some may turnout to be 
good coins and some just get wasted, some may don't even go to exchange - you never know), 
but I've seen very good results by mining new coins.

Best eg; I've early mined PIRL for 5 days and it has paid of my RIG investment and I've 
mined many other shit coins like XMRL, IRD etc which didn't even reached exchanges.

I'm only doing this for people like me who has only 1 RIG to mine and do mining just as a hobby.

Please note that myself/nvOC Team don't affiliate with these coins, I just add them based on my (just myself) 
perception and you make the decision whether to consider it or not.
